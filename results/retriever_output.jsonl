P R E M I S E S A. Lessor is the owner of the real property described as 929 N. Russell, City of Portland, County of Multnomah, State of Oregon (Premises), as more fully described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein; and B. Lessor wishes to continue to lease to Lessee and Lessee wishes to continue to lease from Lessor said real property (Premises): C. This Lease restates and supersedes all lease documents for the Premises executed prior to the date of this document. Where there is a conflict between this Restated Lease and any predecessor documents, this document shall prevail. In consideration of the premises and the covenants expressed herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows: 1. Lease of Premises. Lessor hereby leases and demises to Lessee, and Lessee hereby leases and takes from Lessor, the Premises for the term and upon the agreements, covenants and conditions set forth herein. The Premises consist of the underlying real estate and shell condition upon which Lessees offices, restaurant, and part of its brewery are located. Lessee has made substantial improvements to the shell condition of the Premises. 2. Term. 2.1 The term of this Lease commenced on May 1, 1989 (Commencement Date) and terminates on December 31, 2034, unless sooner terminated pursuant to any provisions hereof. 2.2 Option to Extend. Lessee may extend the term until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the expiration date by written notice of its election to do so given to Lessor at least one (1) year prior to the December 31, 2034 expiration date. Lessee may extend for a second term of ten (10) years by giving written notice to Lessor at least one (1) year prior to the expiration of the first extended term. The terms and conditions of the Lease applicable at the expiration date will govern the extended term; however, the monthly rent will be the fair market rent for the Premises on the expiration date. If Lessor and Lessee are unable to agree upon the fair market rent prior to the expiration date, the question will be submitted to arbitration according to Paragraph 30. In that event, Lessee will continue to pay rent according to the Lease until the arbitration decision is rendered. At that time, Lessor and Lessee will make appropriate adjustments as of the expiration date. Lessee will not have any rights under this Paragraph if: (a) an event of default - 1 - exists on the expiration date or on the date on which Lessee gives its notice; or (b) Lessee exercises its rights less than one (1) year before the expiration date. 3. Rent. 3.1 Lessee will pay Lessor the monthly rent in equal consecutive monthly installments on or before the first day of each month during the term of this Lease. The monthly rent will be paid in advance at the address specified for Lessor in the basic lease information or such other place as Lessor designates, without prior demand and without any abatement, deduction or setoff. If the commencement date occurs on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, or if the expiration date occurs on a day other than the last day of the calendar month, then the monthly rent for each fractional month will be prorated on a daily basis. This is a triple net lease with all expenses, maintenance, renovation, and replacement assumed by Lessee. 3.2 Monthly rent is as follows: Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) per month subject to a yearly consumer price index adjustment as described below. CPI Adjustments: The Basic Annual Rent shall be subject to upward adjustments, based on the Consumer Price Index, one year after the Commencement Date of this Lease and at the end of each subsequent year, during the Lease Term in accordance with the following procedure: (A) The index to be used for this adjustment shall be the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), All Items, U.S. City Average (1982-1984 equals 100), published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. (B) The Base Period Consumer Price index shall be subtracted from the Adjustment Period Consumer Price Index; the difference shall be divided by the Base Period Consumer Price Index. This quotient shall then be multiplied by $3,000.00. The result shall be added to the monthly rent of $3,000.00. This arithmetical sum shall then be the Adjusted Monthly Rent for such immediately succeeding leasehold year which shall be paid monthly. (C) If the Consumer Price Index is, at any time during the term of this Lease, discontinued or no longer published, then the most nearly comparable published measure of inflation, as determined by Lessor in its sole discretion, shall be substituted for the purpose of this calculation. 4. Taxes and Other Charges. 4.1 Lessee agrees to pay and discharge, as additional rent for the Premises during the entire term of this Lease, before delinquency, all taxes, assessments, water rents, sewer rentals, utility rates and fees, levies or other charges of any kind which are or may during the term of this Lease be levied, charged, assessed or imposed upon - 2 - or against the Premises or any buildings or improvements which are hereafter located thereon, or against any legal or equitable interest of Lessor in the Premises, or against any of Lessees personal property now or hereafter located thereon, or which may be levied, charged, assessed or imposed upon or against the leasehold estate created hereby.

JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY. If Tenant is more than one natural person, the individuals collectively referred to herein as Tenant shall be jointly and severally liable with respect to the obligation to pay rent and all of the other obligations, covenants and agreements of Tenant set forth in this Lease. 41. ADDENDA. The provisions, if any, included at the end of this Lease, and any riders and exhibits appended to this Lease, are hereby made a part of this Lease as though set forth in full herein. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord is required to collect employment data from Tenants and shall cause Tenant to provide employment information in Exhibit F as of the Commencement Date and upon request by Landlord thereafter. Tenant further agrees to complete the forms in Exhibits G & H and/or supply other reasonably available employment data from time to time as requested by Landlord. Tenant agrees to complete such forms and provide such information in a timely manner upon request. 42. OPTION TO EXPAND. Provided that Tenant is not then in default beyond any applicable cure period under Section 24, Tenant shall have the right to expand the Premises by up to 7,853 square feet on the first floor, 103 E Badger Road (the First Floor Expansion Space), at the same terms and conditions under this Lease (except for Base Rent as provided below) commencing any time after 12/31/2013 with one hundred eighty (180) day prior notice. If Tenant exercises its right to expand (gives notice) within the first eighteen (18) months of the Lease Term, Landlord shall provide a tenant improvement allowance of twenty-four and 77/100 dollars ($24.77) per square foot for the upfit of the First Floor Expansion Space and any additional upfit will be at Tenants expense. Base Rent for the First Floor Expansion Space shall be equal to $7.65 per rentable square foot escalated at two percent (2%) per annum with the escalation being calculated from the original Commencement Date of the Lease. Tenants option to expand into the First Floor Expansion Space is subject to Landlords right to terminate as outlined in the existing Tenants current lease (AquaMost, Inc.) (the AquaMost Lease), which reads as follows: Landlord reserves the right, provided the effective date of such termination is not before December 31, 2013, to relocate Tenant to substitute premises of comparable size within the Project Landlord shall provide Tenant with written notice by either: 1) 180 day notice, in which case Landlord will pay Tenants out of pocket costs incurred with moving its furniture and equipment, or 2) 120 day notice, in which case Landlord will pay Tenant $25,000 in addition to moving expenses described above (such additional fee shall not be paid if Landlord provides replacement property on terms acceptable to Tenant). If Landlord does not offer a suitable substitute location or if Tenant does not agree on the substitute location within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlords notice, this Lease shall terminate at the end of either the one hundred eighty (180) or one hundred twenty (120) day period following Landlords notice. Should Tenant elect to expand into the First Floor Expansion Space and Landlord is obligated under the AquaMost Lease to pay the $25,000 and/or moving expense, Exact Sciences (Tenant) shall pay the actual, reasonable out of pocket expense to relocate AquaMost, Inc. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant recognizes Landlords desire to accommodate its other tenants in the building to the extent possible. To that end, Tenant agrees to work in good faith with Landlord to minimize negative impacts to such other 17 tenants as a result of exercising its expansion rights. This may include, to the extent practical, Tenant first exercising expansion rights in other areas of the building such as vacant space or the second floor space now occupied by Alexander Co. Further, Tenant agrees in good faith to provide notice whether formal or informal as early as possible giving Landlord as much time as possible to accommodate its other tenants. In addition, provided that Landlord has not leased (subject to Tenants right of first refusal) the space to a 3rd party other than the Alexander Company, Tenant shall have the right to expand into 5,810 square feet (145 E Badger Road, Suite 200) on the second floor (the Second Floor Expansion Space) as is by giving written notice to Landlord within the first eighteen (18) months of the Lease. Base rent for the Second Floor Expansion Space shall be $13 / rsf NNN escalated at two percent (2%) per annum with the escalation being calculated from the original Commencement Date of the Lease. Landlord shall provide new paint and carpet as part of this expansion into the Second Floor Expansion Space. Tenant shall provide a one hundred twenty (120) day prior notice prior to the effective date of such expansion into the Second Floor Expansion Space. If Tenant expands into either the First Floor Expansion Space or the Second Floor Expansion Space, Tenant shall extend the term of this Lease for a period of five (5) years from the effective date of the expansion, and such extension shall not be deemed an exercise of the Extension Option by Tenant. In addition, Tenant shall have the right to expand into 3,189 square feet, if such room is not included in such square footage total, (145 E Badger Road, Suite 102) on the first floor (the Suite 102 Expansion Space) by giving written notice to Landlord within the first twelve (12) months of the Lease. Base rent for the Suite 102 Expansion Space shall be $13 / rsf NNN escalated at two percent (2%) per annum with the escalation being calculated from the original Commencement Date of the Lease.",
