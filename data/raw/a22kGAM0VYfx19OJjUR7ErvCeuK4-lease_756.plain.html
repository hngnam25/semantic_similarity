          <p id="s1p2">LEASE</p>
          <p id="s1p3">THIS LEASE is made and executed this 5th day of April, 2004, between, FIRCO ASSOCIATES L.L.C., a Michigan limited liability company, of Suite 1, 4380 Brockton SE, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49512, as “Landlord”, and CORIUM INTERNATIONAL, INC. a Delaware corporation, of 4558 — 50th Street SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49512, as “Tenant”.</p>
          <p id="s1p4">1. Leased Premises. Landlord is the owner of the real property located at 4524-504 Street, in the City of Kentwood, Kent County, Michigan and more particularly described on attached Exhibit A (the “Property”). Landlord will construct a single story building (containing approximately 4270 square feet of floor area) (the “Building”) and other related improvements (the “Improvements”) on the Property. Landlord LETS AND LEASES to Tenant, and Tenant HIRES AND LEASES from Landlord, that portion of the Building, containing approximately 32,625 square feet of floor area, more particularly described on attached Exhibit B (the “Leased Premises”), at the rents and under the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p5">2. Purpose of Occupancy. Tenant shall occupy and use the Leased Premises for office and warehousing, packaging and assembly purposes and for any related purpose, but for no other purpose without the written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Leased Premises shall not be used for any purpose which would violate any law, ordinance, rule or regulation or the terms of any restrictive covenant applicable to the Building, nor in any way to create any nuisance or trespass, nor in any way to violate the terms of a standard form policy of insurance or increase the rate of insurance under any such policy of insurance on the Building or the Leased Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p6">3. Term of Lease; Renewal Term. The term of this Lease shall commence five months after Landlord obtains all necessary building permits from the City of Kentwood (the “Commencement Date”), and shall continue for ten (10), years thereafter unless sooner terminated as provided in this Lease. Tenant’s taking possession of the Leased Premises shall constitute Tenant’s acceptance of the Leased Premises in their “as is” condition, subject only to the other terms and conditions of this Lease. At the request of Landlord, Tenant shall execute and deliver to Landlord the Acceptance of Premises form attached to this Lease as Exhibit C.</p>
          <p id="s1p7">Provided Tenant is not then in default in the performance of any of its covenants and agreements under this Lease, Tenant may give written notice to terminate this lease as of April 30, 2009. Such written notice is to be given after February 28, 2009 and before April 30, 2009. If the termination option is exercised, Tenant shall pay the unamortized portion of the tenant improvements which are amortized over the ten year term of this lease. Landlord shall have the right to terminate this lease if the land purchase is not closed by May 1, 2004.</p>
          <p id="s1p8">Provided Tenant is not then in default in the performance of any of its covenants and agreements under this Lease, Tenant may renew this Lease for one (1) additional five (5) year term, upon the same terms and conditions as provided in this Lease except as to rent which shall be adjusted as provided in Paragraph 4, below. In order to exercise such renewal rights, Tenant shall serve Landlord with written notice of Tenant’s election to renew not less than six (6) months prior to the end of the term of this Lease or each renewal term, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p9">4. Rent. Tenant covenants and agrees to pay Landlord as rent for the Leased Premises during the term of this Lease and any renewal term as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p10">(a) Base Rent. As Base Rent, Tenant shall pay an amount equal to $99,540.00 per year, payable in equal monthly installments of $8,295.10 subject, however, to adjustment as provided under Paragraph 4(c), below. Base Rent and additional rent shall be paid in advance on the first day of each month during the term and any renewal term of this Lease; provided, however, that Base Rent for the first full month of the term of this Lease shall be paid upon the execution of this Lease. Moreover, in the event the Commencement Date is any day other than the first day of a month, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on the Commencement Date a prorated portion of the monthly Base Rent for the period from the Commencement Date to the first day of the following month.</p>
          <p id="s1p11">(b) Tenant Finish improvements: Additional Rent. Tenant shall provide Landlord with detailed plans and specifications for finishing the interior of the Leased Premises (the “Tenant Finish Improvements”). The plans and specifications for the Tenant Finish Improvements shall be subject to Landlord’s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Tenant’s taking possession of the Leased Premises shall constitute Tenant’s acceptance of the Tenant Finish Improvements in their “as is” condition, subject only to the other terms and conditions of this Lease. As additional rent for the Tenant Finish Improvements, Tenant shall pay Landlord an additional sum determined by amortizing the actual out-of-pocket costs over and above the base shell cost (part of the base rent above) to Landlord for the Tenant Finish Improvements, and a eight percent (8%) factor for a contractor’s fee to First Companies, Inc. Tenant Finish Improvements up to the amount of $97,860.00 (32,625 square feet x 10% x $30.00 square foot) shall be amortized over twenty years. If Tenant expands to the entire building, Tenant Finish Improvements up to $195,720.00 shall be amortized over twenty years. Any Tenant Finish Improvements exceeding the amount stated above shall be amortized over the ten year lease term. In this regard, Tenant acknowledges that Landlord intends to use First Companies, Inc., an affiliate of one of the members of Landlord, as the contractor for the Tenant Finish Improvements. Such amortization shall be at a rate of interest equal to the interest rate charged to the Landlord under the permanent mortgage loan covering the Building. In the event Landlord’s financing is at a variable interest rate, tenant improvement rent shall be calculated based on the best fixed rate available to Landlord for a twenty (20) year amortization loan. Such Tenant Finish Rent shall be due and payable on the first day of each month during the initial term of this Lease and shall be paid in the same manner as Base Rent. Tenant shall have the option to pay for Tenant Finish Improvements as a lump sum at the time of lease commencement.</p>
          <p id="s1p12">(c) CPI Adjustments. The Base Rent paid by Tenant shall be adjusted upward, but never downward, effective as of the first anniversary of the Commencement Date (or the first day of the thirteenth month after the Commencement Date in the event the Commencement Date is a date other than the first day of a calendar month) and on the same day of each year thereafter during the term and any renewal term of this Lease to reflect the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index (All Cities, All Urban Consumers, All Items, 1982-1984=100) (subsequently referred to as “CPI-U”) or</p>
          <p id="s1p13">2</p>
          <p id="s1p14">its successor Consumer Price Index, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. This adjustment shall be computed by adding to the Base Rent an amount determined as follows: i) the CPI-U index number for second month preceding the Commencement Date (“Initial Index Number”) shall be subtracted from the CPI-U index number for the second month immediately preceding the effective date of increase; ii) the resulting amount shall be divided by the Initial Index Number and reduced to a decimal equivalent; iii) the resulting decimal shall be multiplied by the Base Rent. The Base Rent, as adjusted, shall be paid in equal monthly installments as provided in Paragraph 4(a), above. Adjustments shall not exceed four percent (4%) per annum.</p>
          <p id="s1p15">If the CPI-U is changed so that the base year differs from that used for the Initial Index Number, the CPI-U shall be converted in accordance with the conversion factor published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the CPI-U is discontinued or revised during the term of this Lease or any renewal term, such other government index or computation with which it is replaced shall be used in order to obtain substantially the same results as would be obtained if the CPI-U had not been discontinued or revised.</p>
          <p id="s1p16">(d) Additional Rent. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord as additional rent its pro rata share of the operating expenses for the Property, Building and Improvements (the “Operating Expenses”). Tenant’s pro rata share shall be based upon the ratio of the number of square feet of floor area of the Leased Premises to the number of square feet of leasable floor area in the Building, which will be approximately 65,270 square feet. Consequently, Tenant’s pro rata share of Operating Expenses shall be 50% percent.</p>
          <p id="s1p17">As used in this Paragraph 4, “Operating Expenses” shall include all costs of operating and maintaining the Property, Building and Improvements, including, without limitation, the following costs and expenses incurred by Landlord: all property taxes and assessments, real, personal, general and special; utility costs and expenses including water, sewer, electricity, gas and other sources of power for heating, lighting, ventilating or air conditioning, except when separately billed to a tenant of the Building; property management fees; insurance premiums; janitorial services contracted for by Landlord and/or wages, salaries, fringe benefits, and applicable taxes on the employer for services related to the Property, Building and Improvements performed by Landlord’s employees; supplies consumed in connection with cleaning, maintenance and repair, snow removal, lawn care, landscaping, parking, and other exterior grounds maintenance and repair; and all installation, maintenance, repair and replacement costs. “Operating Expenses” shall not include any alterations to meet the specific needs of other tenants of the Building, any capital improvements defined as such in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or leasing commissions, if any.</p>
          <p id="s1p18">Such additional rent shall be computed on the basis of each calendar year and shall be adjusted as of January 1 of each year during the term of this Lease. Tenant shall pay its share of the Operating Expenses in monthly installments on or before the first day of each calendar month, in advance, in an amount estimated by Landlord each year without any deduction or setoff whatsoever beginning on the Commencement Date</p>
          <p id="s1p19">3</p>
          <p id="s1p20">of this Lease. Within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar year, Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a written statement itemizing the Operating Expenses for that calendar year, and a written statement of the amount of the Tenant’s share of said Operating Expenses. If the total amount paid by Tenant for the prior calendar year shall be less than the actual amount due from Tenant for that year, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after written notice, pay to Landlord the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and the actual amount due; if the total amount paid by Tenant for the prior calendar year exceeds the actual amount due from Tenant for that year, Tenant shall receive a credit for such amount against rent to become due under this Lease, or if the Lease term has expired, a refund of such excess from Landlord. Operating expenses for the year 2004 are estimated at $1.15 per square foot per attached exhibit ($3,126.50 per month).</p>
          <p id="s1p21">(e) Payment. The monthly installments of rent and all other sums payable under this Lease by Tenant shall be paid to Landlord at Landlord’s address set forth above, or at such other address as Landlord may direct by written notice, without setoff, counter claim, recoupment, abatement, suspension or deduction.</p>
          <p id="s1p22">5. Taxes and Special Assessments. Subject to Paragraph 4(d) above, Landlord shall pay and discharge all real property taxes and special assessments which may be levied against all or any portion of the Property, Building and Improvements during the term of this Lease. Tenant shall pay and discharge all personal property taxes which may be levied against its furniture, equipment and other personal property located on the Leased Premises.</p>

          <p id="s1p24">(a) “All Risk” coverage in the amount of the full replacement cost of the Building and improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p25">(b) public liability and property damage insurance with coverage of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000.000.00) on a combined single limit basis.</p>
          <p id="s1p26">All such policies of insurance shall be payable to Landlord or as Landlord specifies.</p>
          <p id="s1p27">Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against and save Landlord harmless from any. liability or claim for damages which may be asserted against Landlord by reason of any accident or casualty occurring in, on or about the Leased Premises or otherwise arising from Tenant’s use and occupancy of the Leased Premises except such as arise from the negligence of Landlord, its agents or employees. Tenant, at its expense, shall obtain public liability insurance for the benefit of itself and Landlord and naming Landlord as an additional party insured and loss payee on the policies with limits in amounts of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for injury or death of any one person and not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for damages to property resulting from one casualty, and One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) property damages in the aggregate. Such policies of insurance shall provide that the coverage shall be primary irrespective of any liability insurance provided by Landlord pursuant to this Lease, or otherwise.</p>
          <p id="s1p28">4</p>
          <p id="s1p29">Tenant shall keep such insurance in force during the term of this Lease and deliver certificates of insurance to Lessor showing such coverage in companies satisfactory to the Landlord. If Tenant shall fail to do so, Landlord may obtain the insurance and charge the cost to Tenant as additional rental.</p>
          <p id="s1p30">Tenant, at its expense, shall keep all of its furnishings, equipment and other personal property located on the Leased Premises fully insured against loss or damage by fire and those risks covered by ‘‘extended coverage” as provided in a Michigan standard fire insurance policy. Such policy of insurance shall be payable to Tenant or as Tenant specifies. Tenant hereby releases Landlord from any and all liability for any damage to or loss of such personal property from any cause whatsoever except to the extent such loss or damage is the result of the negligence of Landlord, its agents or employees and is not otherwise covered by insurance required to be carried by Tenant under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p31">7. Waiver of Subrogation. Each policy of insurance authorized or required of either party under this Lease shall contain a clause or endorsement under which the insurer waives all right of subrogation against the other party, its agents and employees with respect to losses payable under such policy, and each party hereby waives all right of recovery it might otherwise have against the other party, its agents and employees for any loss or injury which is covered by such a policy of insurance, notwithstanding that such loss or injury may result from the negligence or fault of such other party, its agents or employees.</p>

Subject to Paragraph 4(d) above, Landlord shall pay all charges for all other utility services necessary for the reasonable use and operation of the Leased Premises and the Building and Improvements.

          <p id="s1p34">Tenant shall keep the Leased Premises in a neat and clean condition, shall not allow refuse to accumulate and shall conduct its business in such a manner that the risk of fire to the Leased Premises shall not be increased beyond the hazard normal and usual for its type of business.</p>

          <p id="s1p204">A. Tenant leases that building containing approximately 65,270 square feet of floor area and commonly known as 4524 50th Street, Kentwood, Michigan (the “Property”) from Landlord pursuant to that Lease dated April 5, 2004 between Tenant, as tenant, and Firco Associates LLC, a Michigan limited liability company, as landlord, as amended by that Amendment to Lease dated November 10, 2004, as further amended by that Amendment to Lease #2 dated March 22, 2007, and subject to that Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement dated September 10, 2007 (the “Lease”). Landlord is the successor in interest to Firco Associates LLC in the Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p205">B. The term of the Lease is presently set to expire on March 31, 2015.</p>
          <p id="s1p206">C. Landlord and Tenant desire by this Amendment to extend the term of the Lease, provide additional options to extend the term of the Lease, adjust the rent to be paid during the extended term, and to make other modifications to the Lease on the terms and conditions set forth in this Amendment. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Amendment shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p207">AGREEMENT</p>
          <p id="s1p208">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual terms, covenants, and conditions contained in this Amendment and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p209">Section 1. Extension of Lease Term. The term of the Lease shall be extended to expire on March 31, 2025 (the “Extended Term”).</p>
          <p id="s1p210">Section 2. Options to Extend Term. Tenant is hereby given two (2) successive options of five (5) years each to extend the Extended Term of the Lease on all of the provisions contained in the Lease, except for Base Rent, following the expiration of the Extended Term (each, an “Option Period”). To exercise an option for an Option Period, Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of its election not less than six (6) months nor more than one (1) year prior to the expiration of the Extended Term or the then-current Option Period, as the case may be. Upon timely and proper exercise of a renewal option, the Option Period shall commence immediately following the expiration of the Extended Term or the then-current Option Period. Time is of the essence of this option provision, and a material term hereof. If Tenant fails to exercise a renewal option granted herein within the time period set forth herein, and by written</p>
          <p id="s1p211">3</p>
          <p id="s1p212">notice in the manner set forth herein, Tenant’s right in the option and any future options shall be null, void, and of no further force and effect and the Lease shall expire at the end of the then-current term. Tenant’s right to exercise any option and the effectiveness of any notice of exercise of any option is, in each instance, subject to the following conditions precedent:</p>
          <p id="s1p213">(a) The Lease shall be in full force and effect at the time notice of exercise of the renewal option is given.</p>
          <p id="s1p214">(b) The Lease shall be in full force and effect on the last day of the term during which notice of exercise of the renewal option is given.</p>
          <p id="s1p215">(c) Tenant shall have no right to exercise any renewal option during the period commencing on the day Landlord gives to Tenant a notice of default and continuing until the default alleged in said notice of default is cured to Landlord’s satisfaction; or during the period commencing on the day after any unpaid monetary obligation of Tenant to Landlord is due, without any necessity for notice thereof to Tenant, and continuing until said monetary obligation is paid in full.</p>
          <p id="s1p216">Section 24 of the Lease governs the assignment and subletting of the Lease, including, without limitation, the options granted herein. The renewal options are not assignable separate and apart from the Lease. The Extended Term and any Option Period (if the option has been effectively exercised) are collectively referred to herein as the “Term.”</p>
          <p id="s1p217">Section 3. Base Rent. The “Base Rent” and other amounts (including, amortized payments of tenant improvements, if any) currently payable under the Lease shall remain in effect through March 31, 2015, including rental adjustments as contemplated in the Lease for the period through March 31, 2015. The Base Rent applicable to the period commencing April 1, 2015 and ending March 31, 2017 shall be $296,978.50 per year, payable in substantially equal monthly installments of $24,748.21 in advance on the first day of each calendar month.</p>
          <p id="s1p218">Section 4. Rental Adjustments. Effective April1, 2015, the Base Rent shall no longer be subject to Consumer Price Index-based adjustments. The Base Rent provided in Section 3 above shall be adjusted on April 1, 2017, and on each April 1 thereafter throughout the remainder of the term of the Lease including any Option Period (each, an “Adjustment Date”) to an amount equal to 102% of the Base Rent in effect immediately before the Adjustment Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p219">Section 5. Tenant Improvement Allowance. On or before December 31, 2012, Landlord shall pay to Tenant the sum of $600,000.00 as an allowance (“Tenant Improvement Allowance”) for the making of certain improvements to the Property by Tenant (the “Tenant Improvements”). Notwithstanding Section 10 of the Lease, Landlord hereby approves Tenant’s plans to make a significant investment to add manufacturing capabilities within the Building as previously provided to Landlord, and Tenant may proceed with such work without any further approval of Landlord, provided that Tenant shall cause the Tenant Improvements to be made in conformity with the remaining procedures and requirements set forth in the Lease with respect to the making of alterations to the Property (other than the need for further approval of Landlord of the plans already reviewed and approved).</p>
          <p id="s1p220">Section 6. Additional Rent. As consideration for Landlord’s payment of the Tenant</p>
          <p id="s1p221">4</p>
          <p id="s1p222">Improvement Allowance to Tenant, Tenant shall pay Landlord monthly additional rent in the amount of $6,170.28 per month (the “Additional Rent”) commencing on January 1, 2013 and continuing through December 31, 2024. The Additional Rent was determined by amortizing the Tenant Improvement Allowance, plus interest at a seven percent (7%) per annum, over a twelve (12) year term. The Additional Rent shall be due and payable in equal monthly payments on the first day of each calendar month in the same manner as Base Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p223">Section 7. Lease Remains in Effect. Except to the extent specifically modified by this Amendment, the Lease remains in full force and effect, including, without limitation, the rights of first refusal granted thereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p224">Section 8. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.</p>
          <p id="s1p225">Section 9. Lender Consent. This Amendment is contingent upon Landlord’s ability to obtain its lender’s written consent and agreement to the terms and conditions set forth in this Amendment.</p>
          <p id="s1p226">Section 10. Brokers. Each party under this Amendment represents and warrants that, except for Colliers International and First Companies (collectively, the “Brokers”), it has dealt with no broker in connection with this Amendment and agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the other from and against any broker’s claim for any commission asserted against the other by virtue of a contract or agreement made or asserted to have been made by the indemnitor related to this Lease. The brokerage commission due to the First Companies by virtue of a separate contract between Landlord and First Companies shall be paid by Landlord. The Landlord shall not have any obligation to pay any brokerage commission to Colliers International arising out of this Amendment.</p>
          <p id="s1p227">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Amendment as of the day and year first set forth above.</p>
