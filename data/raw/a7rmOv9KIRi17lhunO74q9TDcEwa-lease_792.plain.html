          <p id="s1p3">Smithson &amp; McKay Limited Liability Company, Lessor</p>
          <p id="s1p4">and</p>
          <p id="s1p5">Widmer Brothers Brewing Company, Lessee</p>
          <p id="s1p6">Dated As Of January 1, 1994</p>
          <p id="s1p7">RESTATED LEASE</p>
          <p id="s1p8">This Restated Lease, dated as of January 1, 1994, is made between Smithson &amp; McKay Limited Liability Company, an Oregon limited liability company (“Lessor”), and Widmer Brothers Brewing Company, an Oregon Corporation (“Lessee”).</p>
          <p id="s1p9">P R E M I S E S</p>
          <p id="s1p10">A. Lessor is the owner of the real property described as 929 N. Russell, City of Portland, County of Multnomah, State of Oregon (“Premises”), as more fully described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein; and</p>
          <p id="s1p11">B. Lessor wishes to continue to lease to Lessee and Lessee wishes to continue to lease from Lessor said real property (“Premises”):</p>
          <p id="s1p12">C. This Lease restates and supersedes all lease documents for the Premises executed prior to the date of this document. Where there is a conflict between this Restated Lease and any predecessor documents, this document shall prevail.</p>
          <p id="s1p13">In consideration of the premises and the covenants expressed herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p14">1. Lease of Premises. Lessor hereby leases and demises to Lessee, and Lessee hereby leases and takes from Lessor, the Premises for the term and upon the agreements, covenants and conditions set forth herein. The Premises consist of the underlying real estate and shell condition upon which Lessee’s offices, restaurant, and part of its brewery are located. Lessee has made substantial improvements to the shell condition of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p15">2. Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p16">2.1 The term of this Lease commenced on May 1, 1989 (“Commencement Date”) and terminates on December 31, 2034, unless sooner terminated pursuant to any provisions hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p17">2.2 Option to Extend. Lessee may extend the term until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the expiration date by written notice of its election to do so given to Lessor at least one (1) year prior to the December 31, 2034 expiration date. Lessee may extend for a second term of ten (10) years by giving written notice to Lessor at least one (1) year prior to the expiration of the first extended term. The terms and conditions of the Lease applicable at the expiration date will govern the extended term; however, the monthly rent will be the fair market rent for the Premises on the expiration date. If Lessor and Lessee are unable to agree upon the fair market rent prior to the expiration date, the question will be submitted to arbitration according to Paragraph 30. In that event, Lessee will continue to pay rent according to the Lease until the arbitration decision is rendered. At that time, Lessor and Lessee will make appropriate adjustments as of the expiration date. Lessee will not have any rights under this Paragraph if: (a) an event of default</p>
          <p id="s1p18">- 1 -</p>
          <p id="s1p19">exists on the expiration date or on the date on which Lessee gives its notice; or (b) Lessee exercises its rights less than one (1) year before the expiration date.</p>
          <p id="s1p20">3. Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p21">3.1 Lessee will pay Lessor the monthly rent in equal consecutive monthly installments on or before the first day of each month during the term of this Lease. The monthly rent will be paid in advance at the address specified for Lessor in the basic lease information or such other place as Lessor designates, without prior demand and without any abatement, deduction or setoff. If the commencement date occurs on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, or if the expiration date occurs on a day other than the last day of the calendar month, then the monthly rent for each fractional month will be prorated on a daily basis. This is a triple net lease with all expenses, maintenance, renovation, and replacement assumed by Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p22">3.2 Monthly rent is as follows: Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) per month subject to a yearly consumer price index adjustment as described below.</p>
          <p id="s1p23">CPI Adjustments: The Basic Annual Rent shall be subject to upward adjustments, based on the Consumer Price Index, one year after the Commencement Date of this Lease and at the end of each subsequent year, during the Lease Term in accordance with the following procedure:</p>
          <p id="s1p24">(A) The index to be used for this adjustment shall be the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), All Items, U.S. City Average (1982-1984 equals 100), published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
          <p id="s1p25">(B) The Base Period Consumer Price index shall be subtracted from the Adjustment Period Consumer Price Index; the difference shall be divided by the Base Period Consumer Price Index. This quotient shall then be multiplied by $3,000.00. The result shall be added to the monthly rent of $3,000.00. This arithmetical sum shall then be the Adjusted Monthly Rent for such immediately succeeding leasehold year which shall be paid monthly.</p>
          <p id="s1p26">(C) If the Consumer Price Index is, at any time during the term of this Lease, discontinued or no longer published, then the most nearly comparable published measure of inflation, as determined by Lessor in its sole discretion, shall be substituted for the purpose of this calculation.</p>
          <p id="s1p27">4. Taxes and Other Charges.</p>
          <p id="s1p28">4.1 Lessee agrees to pay and discharge, as additional rent for the Premises during the entire term of this Lease, before delinquency, all taxes, assessments, water rents, sewer rentals, utility rates and fees, levies or other charges of any kind which are or may during the term of this Lease be levied, charged, assessed or imposed upon</p>
          <p id="s1p29">- 2 -</p>

All taxes, assessments and other charges covered by this Paragraph 4 shall be prorated between Lessor and Lessee as of the commencement and expiration dates of the Lease Term. If at any time during the term of the Lease any tax, assessment or other charge is levied for a benefit which shall have a useful life longer than the remaining Lease Term, and if the law permits the payment of any such tax, assessment or other charge, in installments (whether or not interest accrues on the unpaid balance), such tax, assessment or other charge shall be paid in installments, with Lessee paying such installment during the term of this Lease and Lessor paying any installments thereafter.</p>
          <p id="s1p31">4.2 Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Lessee shall not be required to pay pursuant to this Paragraph 4 any franchise, capital levy or transfer tax of Lessor, or any income, profits, or excess profits tax, or any tax which may, at any time during the term of this Lease, be required to be paid on any gift, or demise, deed, mortgage, descent or other alienation of any part or all of the estate of Lessor in and to the Premises or any buildings or improvements which are now or hereafter located thereon.</p>
          <p id="s1p32">4.3 Lessee shall furnish to Lessor, upon request, receipts or other appropriate evidence establishing payment of any taxes, assessments or other charges required to be paid hereunder by Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p33">4.4 Lessee shall pay prior to delinquency all taxes assessed against and levied upon trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal property of Lessee contained in the Premises. When possible, Lessee shall cause said trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal property to be assessed and billed separately from the real property of Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p34">If any of Lessee’s said personal property shall be assessed with Lessor’s real property, Lessee shall pay the taxes attributable to Lessee prior to the delinquency date for payment of such taxes, provided that Lessor shall at reasonable time prior thereto provide Lessee with a written statement setting forth the taxes applicable to Lessee’s property and an explanation of Lessor’s method of computation thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p35">5. Lessor’s Warranty of Title and Quiet Enjoyment. Lessor hereby covenants and warrants to Lessee that Lessor has good and marketable fee simple title to the Premises, free and clear of all claims, liens and encumbrances except those certain exceptions set forth in the Title Report attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit B. Upon Lessee paying the rent reserved hereunder and observing and performing all of the covenants, conditions and provisions on Lessee’s part to be observed and performed hereunder, Lessee shall peaceably hold and quietly enjoy the Premises for the entire term hereof, without hindrance, molestation or interruption by Lessor or any other party. Without limiting the</p>
          <p id="s1p36">- 3 -</p>
          <p id="s1p37">generality of the foregoing, Lessor shall pay prior to delinquency all sums due and owing under any encumbrance on the fee interest in the Premises, and shall perform in a timely fashion all covenants and obligations on Lessor’s part to be performed under any such encumbrances. In the event Lessor fails to pay sums due or perform such covenants and obligations under such encumbrances, Lessee shall be entitled, upon no less than ten (10) days written notice to Lessor, to pay any such sums, perform any such covenants or obligations or cure any defaults under such encumbrances and offset any sums paid or expended in performance or curing with interest thereon at the rate of twelve percent (12%), against the rental owing hereunder. Lessor hereby warrants and certifies that as of the date hereof there are no defaults, or events which with the passage of time or the giving of notice of both would become defaults, under any encumbrances on the fee interest in the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p38">6. Use. Lessee shall have the right to use the Premises for any lawful purpose, in accordance with all present and future zoning laws, rules and regulations of governmental authorities having jurisdiction thereof, and subject to all covenants, easements and rights-of-way of record, if any, which are presently in existence and irrespective of whether the same are being contested by Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p39">7. Condition of Premises; Utilities.</p>
          <p id="s1p40">7.1 Lessee hereby accepts the Premises in an “as is” condition, existing as of the date of the execution hereof, subject to all applicable zoning, municipal, county and state ordinances and regulations covering and regulating the use of the Premises, and accepts this Lease subject thereto and to all matters disclosed thereby. Lessee acknowledges that neither Lessor nor Lessor’s agent has made any representation or warranty as to the suitability of the Premises for the conduct of any type of business.</p>
          <p id="s1p41">7.2 Lessee shall pay for all water, sewer, gas, heat, light, power, steam, telephone, or other utilities and services supplied to the Premises, together with any taxes thereon.</p>
          <p id="s1p42">8. Repairs, Governmental Regulations and Waste.</p>
          <p id="s1p43">8.1 Lessee shall keep the Premises as improved and every part thereof, structural or non-structural, in good order, condition and repair, whether or not such portion of the Premises requiring repair, or the means of repairing the same, are reasonably or readily accessible to Lessee, and whether or not the need for such repairs occurs as a result of Lessee’s use, any prior use, the elements or the age of such portion of the Premises, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all plumbing, heating, air conditioning, ventilating, electrical lighting facilities and equipment from time to time within the Premises, fixtures, walls (interior and exterior), floors, windows, doors, plate glass and sky lights located within the Premises, and all landscaping, driveways, parking lots, fences and signs located on the Premises, and sidewalks adjacent to the Premises.

Lessee shall, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense comply promptly with all applicable statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations and restrictions of record, if any, and requirements in effect during the term of this Lease regulating the use by Lessee of the Premises. Lessee agrees and acknowledges that it has inspected the Premises and has made all necessary investigations and inquiries with respect to compliance by Lessor with all applicable current municipal, county and state statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations and assumes full responsibility for compliance therewith.</p>
          <p id="s1p47">8.3 If Lessee fails to perform Lessee’s obligations under this Paragraph 8, Lessor may, at its option (but shall not be required to), enter upon the Premises after thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lessee of the specific failures of Lessee under this Paragraph 8, and provided that Lessee has not theretofore cured such failures or, in the case of any such failure which cannot be cured within said 30-day period, commenced to cure the same and thereafter is diligently prosecuting such curing), put the same in good order, condition and repair, and the cost thereof, together with interest thereon at the rate of twelve (12%) percent per annum, shall become due and payable as additional rental to Lessor together with Lessee’s next rental installment.</p>
          <p id="s1p48">8.4 Except for the obligations of Lessor under Paragraph 10 (Damage or Destruction) and Paragraph 16 (Eminent Domain), it is intended by the parties hereto that Lessor shall have no obligation in any manner whatsoever to repair and maintain the Premises, nor any buildings or improvements located thereon, nor the equipment therein, whether structural or nonstructural, all of which obligations are those of Lessee under this paragraph. Lessee expressly waives the benefit of any statute now or hereafter in effect which would otherwise afford Lessee the right to make repairs at Lessor’s expense, or to terminate this Lease because of Lessor’s failure to keep the Premises in good order, condition and repair.</p>
          <p id="s1p49">8.5 Lessee shall have the right to contest by appropriate judicial or administrative proceedings, without cost or expense to Lessor, the validity or application of any law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement (hereinafter called “law”) that Lessee repair, maintain, alter or replace the improvements on the Premises in whole or in part or that would affect Lessee’s use of the Premises. In the event that any such contest is finally determined in a manner adverse to Lessee, Lessee shall either undertake such repairs, maintenance, alterations or replacements to or of the Premises as is required by such law or modify its use of the Premises as is required by such law.</p>

Subject to Lessee’s right of contest under this Restated Lease, if at any time during the term of this Lease, Lessee fails or neglects to do any of the things herein required to be done by Lessee, Lessor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to do the same, but at the cost of and for the account of Lessee. Provided, however, Lessor shall in no case take such action sooner than thirty (30) days after giving Lessee written notice of such failure, refusal, or neglect and allowing said period within which Lessee may commence a bona fide effort to cure the same. The amount of any money so expended by Lessor together with interest thereon at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum shall be repaid to Lessor immediately upon demand therefor and unless so paid shall be added to the next rental payment coming due hereunder.</p>

No waiver of any default under this Lease shall constitute or operate as a waiver of any subsequent default hereunder, and no delay, failure or omission in exercising or enforcing any right, privilege, or option under this Lease shall constitute a waiver, abandonment or relinquishment thereof or prohibit or prevent any election under or enforcement or exercise of any right, privilege or option hereunder. No waiver of any provision hereof by Lessor or Lessee shall be deemed to have been made unless and until such waiver shall have been reduced to writing and signed by Lessor or Lessee, as the case may be. The receipt by Lessor of rent with knowledge of any default under this Lease shall not constitute or operate as a waiver of such default.</p>

          <p id="s1p155">21.1 There shall be no merger of the leasehold estate created by this Lease with the fee estate in the Premises by reason of the fact that the same person may on or hold (i) the leasehold estate created by this Lease or any interest in such leasehold estate and (ii) the fee estate in the Premises or any interest in such fee estate; and no merger shall occur unless and until Lessor, Lessee and any Lender shall join in a written instrument effecting such merger and shall duly record the same.</p>
          <p id="s1p156">21.2 No termination of this Lease shall cause a merger of the estates of Lessor and Lessee, unless Lessor so elects, and any such termination shall, at the option of Lessor, either work a termination of any sublease in effect or act as an assignment to Lessor of Lessee’s interest in any such sublease.</p>

This Lease shall terminate without further notice upon the expiration of the term specified, and any holding over by Lessee after the expiration of said term shall not constitute a renewal hereof or give Lessee any rights hereunder or in or to the Premises.</p>

          <p id="s1p181">28.1 Lessor hereby grants to Lessee an exclusive and irrevocable option (the “Option”) to purchase the Premises, for the price and upon the terms and conditions specified herein, at any time during the term hereof, except the last twelve (12) months of the lease term or extension thereof. Lessee may exercise the Option by giving Lessor six (6) months’ written notice of exercise of the Option. Upon exercise of the Option and provided Lessee is not in default of any monetary obligation hereunder or otherwise in material default hereunder, Lessor shall be obligated to sell and convey to Lessee and Lessee shall be obligated to purchase from Lessor the Premises for a purchase price as determined by the method in Exhibit C attached hereto and incorporated herein, except the last twelve (12) months of the lease term or extension thereof.</p>

If the appraisal process is not complete within said time, the purchase price shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the Closing Date until paid. The Closing shall be through an escrow opened by Lessee with a title insurance company (“Title Company”) qualified to do business in the State of Oregon and located in the City of Portland and County of Multnomah. Prior to the Closing Date, Lessor and Lessee shall deposit in escrow with Title Company all documents and funds necessary to close the purchase and sale hereunder, together with escrow instructions consistent herewith. Lessor shall convey to Lessee, by statutory general warranty deed, fee simple title to the Premises (or such portion thereof as shall not have been taken by eminent domain in the event of such taking prior to the Closing Date), subject only to the lien of taxes, assessments or other charges payable by Lessee under this Lease, such matters as are set forth in Exhibit B hereto and such other matters as may be created, suffered to be created or consented to by Lessee (including without limitation, any subleases of space then in effect covering space in the building on the Premises), or by Lessor at Lessee’s request (evidence of such title to be an ALTA owner’s policy of title insurance), and shall assign to Lessee any eminent domain award with respect to the Premises or proceeds of insurance resulting from damage or destruction to the Premises which have not been previously paid to Lessor and to which Lessee is entitled under the provisions of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p184">28.3 The cost of the premium for the title insurance policy issued to Lessee on the Closing Date shall be paid by Lessee. Any transfer taxes payable with respect to the conveyance shall be paid by Lessor. Escrow fees shall be paid one-half (1/2) by Lessor and one-half (1/2) by Lessee. All other costs of closing escrow shall be borne in accordance with the custom then prevailing in the County of Multnomah. Lessee shall continue to pay rent and other charges as may be due hereunder to and including the date of the closing of escrow.</p>

          <p id="s1p187">29.1 If at any time during the term of this Lease: (i) Lessor receives an offer from a third party to purchase its fee title to the Premises or any part thereof or interest therein, and Lessor desires to accept it; or (ii) if Lessor makes an offer to sell, transfer, or assign its fee title to the Premises or any part thereof or interest therein, then Lessor shall deliver to Lessee immediate notice of such offer, setting forth the name and address of the proposed purchaser or transferee, an amount of the proposed purchase price, and all other terms and conditions of such offer, and Lessee shall have the right of first refusal to purchase such fee title to the Premises or such part thereof or interest therein which is the subject of the offer</p>

In the event that Lessee fails to notify Lessor within said thirty (30) day period of Lessee’s election to exercise its right of first refusal, or in the event Lessee notifies Lessor within said period that Lessee will not exercise its right of first refusal, Lessor may proceed to sell, transfer or assign its fee title or part thereof or interest therein to the third party within ninety (90) days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, but only on the same terms and conditions as were offered to Lessee, and any change in such terms and conditions shall be deemed to be a new offer and Lessee shall in such event not consummate any sale, assignment or other transfer to any third party but shall first submit the changed terms and conditions to Lessee for determination by Lessee in the manner provided above as to whether it will elect to exercise its right of first refusal on the changed terms and conditions. In the event that Lessee has elected not to exercise its right of first refusal and the sale or transfer of the Lessor’s interest in the Premises as described in the offer is not completed for any reason within the aforesaid ninety (90) day period, the Lessee shall have, upon the same conditions and notice, the continuing right of first refusal to purchase Lessor’s interest in the Premises upon the terms of any subsequent offer or offers, even though Lessee declined to exercise its right of first refusal with respect to any prior transaction. In the event that Lessee acquires Lessor’s interest in the Premises pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Lessor shall convey title to Lessee by a grant deed or instrument of assignment, as the case may be, in form for recording, the form of which shall be subject to reasonable approval by Lessee’s counsel. If the Lessee exercises said right of first refusal, all funds and documents shall be placed in escrow, and the transaction shall be consummated through said escrow within ninety (90) days after Lessee gives Lessor notice of the exercise of the right of first refusal. The parties agree that there will be no right of first refusal during the last twelve (12) months of any lease term.</p>
          <p id="s1p190">29.2 Lessee shall continue to pay the rent and other charges, as required by the terms and provisions of this Lease to and including the date the escrow closes for the purchase of the real property.</p>
          <p id="s1p191">29.3 Lessee agrees and acknowledges that if it elects to purchase the Premises pursuant to its right of first refusal, as herein provided, neither Lessor nor anyone acting for and on behalf of Lessor has made any representations, statements, or warranties concerning the physical condition of the Premises to be conveyed pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Paragraph 29.</p>

          <p id="s1p196">30.3 If said two (2) arbitrators cannot agree within said period, they shall, within a period of thirty (30) additional days, agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator.</p>

          <p id="s1p199">30.6 If either Lessor or Lessee fails to appoint an arbitrator within the time limited in Subparagraph 30.1 above, or if the two (2) arbitrators appointed by Lessor and Lessee fail to agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator, such second or third arbitrator (as the case maybe), shall be appointed by the presiding judge of the Circuit Court in and for the County of Multnomah upon application by either party. Except as provided hereunder, the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the laws then in effect of the State of Oregon relating to arbitration.</p>
          <p id="s1p200">30.7 Each of the parties hereto shall pay for the services of its appointees, attorneys and witnesses plus one-half (1/2) of the fee charged by the third arbitrator (if any) and one-half (1/2) of all other proper costs relating to arbitration.</p>
          <p id="s1p201">30.8 All arbitrators appointed pursuant to this Paragraph 30 shall be real estate brokers of M.A.I. appraisers who are familiar with appraisal procedures and with commercial property values in the City of Portland and County of Multnomah.</p>
          <p id="s1p202">31. Unavoidable Delays Force Majeure. If either party shall be delayed or prevented from the performance of any act required by this Lease by reason of acts of God, strikes, lockouts, labor troubles, inability to secure materials, restrictive governmental laws or regulations, or other cause, without fault and beyond the reasonable control of the party obligated (financial inability excepted), performance of such act shall be excused for the period of the delay; and the period for the performance of any such act shall be extended for a period equivalent to the period of such delay; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall excuse Lessee from the obligation to pay when due all rental and other monetary charges required of Lessee. The party delayed or prevented from the performance of any act as above described shall notify the other of such delay or prevention within fifteen (15) days of the inception thereof, and shall thereafter keep said party regularly informed of the status of such delay or prevention.</p>
          <p id="s1p203">- 25 -</p>
          <p id="s1p204">32. Exchange. In the event Lessee exercises its options to purchase the Premises pursuant to either the Option to Purchase or the Right of First Refusal at Paragraphs 28 or 29, Lessor may elect to effect an exchange of its interest in the Premises pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. In such event, Seller shall not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date on which escrow is to close for such purchase, designate certain other property (the “Exchange Property”) that it will take in exchange for the Premises. Upon Lessor’s designation of the Exchange Property, Lessee will cooperate with Lessor in entering into an agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) whereby Lessee shall acquire the Exchange Property. The closing on the Exchange Agreement shall occur simultaneous with the close of escrow under Paragraphs 28 and 29 hereof. Lessee shall not be required to pay more cash to close the Exchange Property than the cash required to be paid by Lessee pursuant to Paragraphs 28 and 29 hereof, Lessor agrees to accept the Exchange Property in exchange of moneys paid by Lessee for the Exchange Property, and Lessee shall receive at the close of escrow a credit against the moneys owed by Lessee pursuant to Paragraphs 28 and 29 hereof, including without limitation the purchase price of the Exchange Property, all ancillary costs and expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees, in acquiring the Exchange Property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it is understood that Lessee’s obligation under this Paragraph 32 shall be limited to executing such documents to facilitate the purchase of the Exchange Property as may be provided to Lessee by Lessor. Any such documents submitted to Lessee by Lessor shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p205">Lessor agrees to indemnify and save Lessee harmless against any and all liabilities, penalties, demands, claims, causes of action, suits, losses, damages, costs and expenses, arising out of or relating to Lessee’s purchase or contracting to purchase the Exchange Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p206">33. General Provisions.</p>
          <p id="s1p207">33.1 Each party hereby agrees to indemnify the other party from and against any real estate brokerage commissions or other such obligations incurred by the indemnifying party as a result of the negotiation or execution of this Lease.</p>
