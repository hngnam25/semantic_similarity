Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to minimize interference with Tenant’s use and occupancy of the Renewed Premises during any such access, but Landlord shall not be required to employ labor at overtime rates.</p>
          <p id="s1p86">(c)Provided Tenant is not then in default under this Lease beyond any applicable notice and grace periods (provided that upon the cure of any such default, Landlord shall be obligated hereunder), Landlord’s Renewed Premises Contribution shall be disbursed by Landlord in progress payments to Tenant in accordance herewith upon Tenant’s delivery of (i) a detailed itemization of the leasehold improvements installed by Tenant in the Renewed Premises; (ii) the written certification of Tenant’s architect (dated no more than thirty (30) days prior to such request) stating (1) that the amounts requisitioned are proper in all material respects, (2) what percentage of the Renewed Premises Work has been completed, (3) that the work and materials represented thereby have been installed substantially in accordance with the approved plans, (4) that no part of such expenditure is being made the basis, in any previous or then pending prior request, for the receipt of Landlord’s Renewed Premises Contribution or has been made out of the proceeds of Landlord’s Renewed Premises Contribution received by Tenant, and (5) that the sum then requested does not exceed the value of the services and materials described in the certificate; (iii) a written</p>

          <p id="s1p90">(e)Upon the completion of all of the Renewed Premises Work, Tenant shall provide to Landlord (i) the certificate of Tenant’s architect stating that the work has been completed substantially in accordance with Tenant’s plans, (ii) an affidavit from Tenant’s general contractor that all sub-contractors, laborers, material suppliers for the Renewed Premises Work have been paid in full and that all liens therefor that have been filed have been bonded, discharged of record or waived, (iii) certificates and approvals required to be obtained by Tenant or Tenant’s architect with respect to the work, that may be required by any governmental authority, have been obtained and copies given to Landlord, (iv) releases of lien with respect to the payment being requested from the general contractor and any contractors or sub-contractors hired by Tenant to supervise or perform any work within the Renewed Premises, (v) “as built” plans and specifications for the alterations constituting the Renewal Premises Work, (vi) all Department of Buildings sign-offs and inspection certificates (or, in lieu of inspection certificates, to the extent permitted by the Building Department, certification by the Tenant’s architect pursuant to permitted “self-certification procedures”), and any permits required to be issued by the Department of Buildings or any other governmental entities having jurisdiction thereover, (vii) Letter of Completion from the Department of Buildings, (viii) Letter of Approval from the FDNY and (ix) such other documentation pertaining to the Renewed Premises Work as Landlord may reasonably require, provided that such other documentation is reasonable and customary under the circumstances. At such time as Tenant shall have provided to Landlord all of the items referenced in clauses (i) through (ix), and provided Tenant is not then in default under this Lease beyond any applicable notice and grace periods (provided that upon the cure of any such default, Landlord shall be obligated hereunder), Landlord shall release to Tenant the portion of Landlord’s Renewed Premises Contribution withheld pursuant to the preceding Section 8(d).

          <p id="s1p92">(g)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, provided Tenant is not in default under the Lease (provided that upon the cure of any such default, Landlord shall be obligated hereunder), in the event Tenant: (i) completes the Renewed Premises Work, but does not utilize all or any portion of the Landlord’s Renewed Premises Contribution or elects not to pursue any Renewal Premises Work; and (ii) delivers written notice thereof to Landlord, Landlord shall have the option to either: (x) permit Tenant to use such unused portion as a credit against future Fixed Rent payments due in respect of the Renewed Premises on and after October 1, 2019; or (y) pay Tenant an amount equal to such unused portion, which payment shall in no event be made prior to October 1, 2019. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord and Tenant each acknowledge and agree that the Renewed Premises Work shall not be deemed to be complete until Tenant has delivered all of the items required to be delivered pursuant to Section 8(e) of this Modification of Lease.</p>
