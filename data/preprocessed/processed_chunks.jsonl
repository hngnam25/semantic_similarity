Such Tenant Finish Rent shall be due and payable on the first day of each month during the initial term of this Lease and shall be paid in the same manner as Base Rent. Tenant shall have the option to pay for Tenant Finish Improvements as a lump sum at the time of lease commencement. (c) CPI Adjustments. The Base Rent paid by Tenant shall be adjusted upward, but never downward, effective as of the first anniversary of the Commencement Date (or the first day of the thirteenth month after the Commencement Date in the event the Commencement Date is a date other than the first day of a calendar month) and on the same day of each year thereafter during the term and any renewal term of this Lease to reflect the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index (All Cities, All Urban Consumers, All Items, 1982-1984=100) (subsequently referred to as CPI-U) or 2 its successor Consumer Price Index, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. This adjustment shall be computed by adding to the Base Rent an amount determined as follows: i) the CPI-U index number for second month preceding the Commencement Date (Initial Index Number) shall be subtracted from the CPI-U index number for the second month immediately preceding the effective date of increase; ii) the resulting amount shall be divided by the Initial Index Number and reduced to a decimal equivalent; iii) the resulting decimal shall be multiplied by the Base Rent. The Base Rent, as adjusted, shall be paid in equal monthly installments as provided in Paragraph 4(a), above. Adjustments shall not exceed four percent (4%) per annum. If the CPI-U is changed so that the base year differs from that used for the Initial Index Number, the CPI-U shall be converted in accordance with the conversion factor published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the CPI-U is discontinued or revised during the term of this Lease or any renewal term, such other government index or computation with which it is replaced shall be used in order to obtain substantially the same results as would be obtained if the CPI-U had not been discontinued or revised. (d) Additional Rent. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord as additional rent its pro rata share of the operating expenses for the Property, Building and Improvements (the Operating Expenses).

Consequently, Tenants pro rata share of Operating Expenses shall be 50% percent.

Operating Expenses shall not include any alterations to meet the specific needs of other tenants of the Building, any capital improvements defined as such in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or leasing commissions, if any. Such additional rent shall be computed on the basis of each calendar year and shall be adjusted as of January 1 of each year during the term of this Lease. Tenant shall pay its share of the Operating Expenses in monthly installments on or before the first day of each calendar month, in advance, in an amount estimated by Landlord each year without any deduction or setoff whatsoever beginning on the Commencement Date 3 of this Lease. Within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar year, Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a written statement itemizing the Operating Expenses for that calendar year, and a written statement of the amount of the Tenants share of said Operating Expenses. If the total amount paid by Tenant for the prior calendar year shall be less than the actual amount due from Tenant for that year, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after written notice, pay to Landlord the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and the actual amount due; if the total amount paid by Tenant for the prior calendar year exceeds the actual amount due from Tenant for that year, Tenant shall receive a credit for such amount against rent to become due under this Lease, or if the Lease term has expired, a refund of such excess from Landlord.

If Landlord shall fail to perform any covenant or condition of this Lease upon Landlords part to be performed and, as a consequence of such default, Tenant shall recover a money judgment against Landlord, such judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received upon execution of such judgment and levied thereon against the right, title and interest of Landlord in the Project and out of rents or other income from such property receivable by Landlord and Landlord shall not be personally liable for any deficiency. 21. CASUALTY. If the Premises are destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty covered by a standard fire and extended coverage policy, then (unless this Lease is terminated by Landlord as hereinafter provided) Landlord shall proceed, after adjustment of such loss, to repair or restore the Premises to the condition immediately prior to the casualty, and such repairs and restoration shall be completed within two hundred seventy (270) days after the date of the casualty. In no event shall Landlord be obligated to expend an amount in excess of the insurance proceeds available to Landlord for such repair or restoration. If Landlord repairs or restores the Premises as provided herein, then Tenant shall repair and restore its furnishings, furniture and equipment to at least a condition equal to that prior to its damage, but only to the extent Tenant receives sufficient insurance proceeds for such repairs and restoration.

{"text": "part thereof shall be rendered untenantable by any destruction or damage, then a pro rata portion of the rent based upon the number of square feet of area in the Premises which are untenantable shall be abated until the Premises or such part thereof shall have been put in tenantable condition. If, however, any destruction or damage to the Premises, Building or Project (regardless of whether or not the Premises are affected) is so extensive that Landlord, in its sole discretion, elects not to repair or restore the Premises, Building or Project, or the proceeds of insurance are not sufficient or available to fully pay the cost of repair or restoration, then Landlord may terminate this Lease effective as of the date of the damage by written notice to Tenant within ninety (90) days after the date of the casualty. The provisions of this Section are subject to the rights of Landlords mortgagees, if any. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 21 to the contrary, if by reason of any casualty, the Premises are rendered untenantable in some material portion, and the amount of time estimated by Landlord required to repair the damage using due diligence is in excess of two hundred seventy (270) days, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination to Landlord within sixty (60) days after the date of casualty. Also, if during the last twelve months of the Term (as same may be extended) there should be a casualty loss to the Premises or the Building to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of the replacement value thereof or if the Premises are rendered untenantable for the conduct of Tenants business operations, Tenant may, at its option, terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination to Landlord within sixty (60) days after the date of the casualty. 22. CONDEMNATION. If all or substantially all of the Premises are sold to or taken by any public authority under its power of condemnation or the threat thereof, this Lease shall terminate as of the date possession shall be transferred to the acquiring authority, and the rent payable hereunder shall be apportioned accordingly. If any material part of the Project is sold or taken (whether or not the Premises are affected), Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease as of the date possession is transferred to the acquiring authority, upon giving written notice thereof to Tenant, and the rent payable hereunder shall be apportioned accordingly. Upon any taking of less than substantially all of the Premises, this Lease shall continue in force as to the part of the Premises not taken, and the rent payable thereafter shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of total floor area of the Premises taken. In the event of any such taking, Landlord, upon receipt and to the extent of the award in condemnation or proceeds of sale, shall, unless this Lease has been terminated, make necessary repairs and restorations to restore the Premises remaining to as near its former condition as circumstances will permit and to rebuild or restore the remainder of the 12 Premises to the approximate condition in which they existed at the time of such taking. In any event, all damages awarded by or amounts paid by the acquiring authority for any such taking, whether for the whole or a part of the Premises or the Building, Common Areas or Project, shall belong to and be the sole property of Landlord whether such damages are awarded as compensation for loss of, or diminution in value to, the leasehold or the fee thereof; provided, however, Tenant shall have the right to pursue such claim or claims as Tenant may have legally for the fair market value of Tenants Work actually paid for by Tenant (and not paid for by Landlord or from the Tenant Improvement Allowance), its leasehold estate, relocation expenses, interruption of business and such items which do not reduce the award or proceeds of sale payable to Landlord. In the event that this Lease is terminated as hereinabove provided, Tenant shall not have any claim against Landlord for the value of the unexpired term hereof. The provisions of this Paragraph are subject to the rights of Landlords mortgagees, if any. If a substantial portion of the Premises or the Building is taken under the power of condemnation (including any conveyance made in lieu thereof) or if any taking of the Premises, Building or any common areas of or serving the Building shall materially impair the normal operation of Tenants business, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice of such termination within thirty (30) days after such taking. 23. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING. Tenant shall not assign, pledge, mortgage or otherwise transfer or encumber this Lease or sublet any part or all of the Premises and shall not permit any use of any part of the Premises by any other party, or any transfer of as interest in the Premises by operation of law without Landlords consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or denied; provided, however, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Tenant shall be permitted to assign this Lease or sublet all or any portion of the Premises, without the consent of Landlord, (i) to an entity into which Tenant may merge, which Tenant may acquire, or which Tenant may consolidate with, (ii) to any parent or subsidiary of Tenant, or (iii) to a purchaser of substantially all of Tenants assets or a controlling interest in the outstanding voting stock of Tenant (iv) to any entity which is affiliated with Tenant or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Tenant..

Without waiving Landlords right hereunder to declare a default in the event of an assignment of this Lease or a subletting of the Premises or any part thereof or occupancy of the Premises by anyone other than Tenant, Landlord may collect from the assignee, sublessee or occupant, any rental and other charges herein required, but such collection by Landlord shall not be deemed an acceptance of the assignee, sublessee or occupancy, nor a release of Tenant from the performance by Tenant of this Lease. Further, Tenant at all times and under all circumstances shall remain liable to Landlord for the payment of rent due and to become due and the performance of all other obligations of Tenant hereunder for the term hereof. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, any costs and expenses including reasonable attorney fees incurred by Landlord in connection with any proposed or purported assignment, sublease or other transfer requiring Landlords consent, such total amount not to exceed $1,500. All option rights, extension rights, renewal rights, expansion rights, and rights of first refusal will flow through to all assignees or subtenants. 24. DEFAULT. If (a) Tenant shall fail to pay the rent or any charge due hereunder within five (5) days after written notice from Landlord, or (b) Tenant shall fail to perform any of the other covenants or conditions herein contained on the part of Tenant, and such default shall continue for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof shall have been given to Tenant (except that such thirty (30) day period shall be automatically extended for an additional period of time reasonably necessary to cure such default, if such default cannot be cured within such thirty (30) day period and provided Tenant commences the process of curing such 13 default within said thirty (30) day period and continuously and diligently prosecutes such cure to completion, and except that, if Tenant fails to timely deliver any subordination instruments under Section 30 or estoppel certificates under Section 32, no additional grace period shall be allowed beyond the ten (10) days referred to in such sections), or (c) if this Lease shall, by act of Tenant or by operation of law or otherwise, pass to any party other than Tenant in violation of this Lease, or (d) intentionally deleted, or (e) Tenant or any guarantor of this Lease shall become insolvent or bankrupt or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (f) a receiver or trustee of Tenants property or that of any guarantor of this Lease shall be appointed and such receiver or trustee, as the case may be, shall not be discharged within thirty (30) days after such appointment, or (g) an execution or attachment is levied against Tenants property or that of any guarantor of this Lease and is not bonded or otherwise removed within thirty (30) days, Landlord may, upon notice to Tenant, recover possession of and reenter the Premises without affecting Tenants liability for past rent and other charges due or future rent and other charges to accrue hereunder. In the event of any such default beyond any applicable notice and cure period, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant, in addition to rent and other charges equivalent to rent, all other damages sustained by Landlord on account of the breach of this Lease, including, but not limited to, reasonable the costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by Landlord in enforcing the terms and provisions hereof and in reentering and recovering possession of the Premises and for the cost of repairs, alterations and brokerage and attorney fees connected with the reletting of the Premises. Further, at the election of Landlord, Landlord shall have the right to declare this Lease terminated and cancelled, without any further rights or obligations on the part of Landlord or Tenant (other than Tenants obligation for rent and other charges due and owing through the date of termination), so that Landlord may relet the Premises without any right on the part of Tenant to any credit or payment resulting from any reletting of the Premises. In case of a default under this Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure period, Landlord may, in addition to terminating this Lease, or in lieu thereof, pursue such other remedy or combination or remedies and recover such other damages for breach of tenancy and/or contract as available at law or otherwise. Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, cure any default by Tenant (specifically including, but not by way of limitation, Tenants failure to obtain insurance, make repairs, or satisfy lien claims) and whenever Landlord so elects, all reasonable costs and expenses paid by Landlord in curing such default, including without limitation attorney fees, shall be payable to Landlord as additional rent due on demand, together with interest at the rate provided in Section 26 below from the date of the advance to the date of repayment by Tenant to Landlord. A waiver by Landlord of a breach or default by Tenant under the terms and conditions of this Lease shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default nor of any other term or condition of this Lease, and the failure of Landlord to assert any breach or to declare a default by Tenant shall not be construed to constitute a waiver thereof so long as such breach", "document_id": "a3HA2M9pF0nnxsQHv1Tr9fjiV6w4-lease_591.plain", "chunk_id": "a3HA2M9pF0nnxsQHv1Tr9fjiV6w4-lease_591.plain_9", "heading": null}

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, following an default that is not timely cured under this Section 24, Landlord shall be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all damages which may accrue hereunder, at law or in equity as a result of any default or breach by Tenant of any of the terms of this Lease. 25. COSTS AND ATTORNEY FEES. Tenant shall pay all costs, expenses and reasonable attorney fees that may be incurred or paid by Landlord in enforcing the covenants and agreements of this Lease, whether or not litigation is commenced. 26. INTEREST. Any amount due from Tenant to Landlord hereunder which is not paid when due after any applicable notice and cure period shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) five percent (5%) per annum in excess of the prime rate of interest announced, from time to time, by The Wall Street Journal, or, if such publication ceases publication, by another reputable financial periodical selected 14 by Landlord, or (ii) twelve percent (12%) per annum (but in no event shall such rate of interest exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged by law) (the Default Rate) from the date due until paid, compounded monthly, but the payment of such interest shall not excuse or cure any default by Tenant under this Lease. 27. SURRENDER. Upon the termination of this Lease, by expiration or otherwise, Tenant shall peaceably surrender the Premises to Landlord broom-clean and in good condition and repair consistent with Tenants duty to make repairs as provided herein. All Alterations and decorations made to the Premises by Tenant shall remain and be the property of the Landlord unless Landlord shall require Tenant, at Tenants expense, to remove any or all thereof and repair the damage caused by such removal, such notice of removal of Alterations to be given to Tenant at the time such Alterations are approved by Landlord. All furniture, equipment and unattached movable personal property owned by Tenant may (and upon Landlords request shall) be removed from the Premises by Tenant no later than the termination date, and Tenant shall repair any and all damage caused by such removal. If the Premises are not surrendered upon the termination of this Lease as set forth herein, Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against all loss or liability actually incurred by Landlord resulting solely from delay by Tenant in so surrendering the Premises including, without limitation, any prevailing claim made by any succeeding tenant founded on such delay. Tenant shall also surrender all keys to the Premises and shall inform Landlord of combinations in any locks, safes and vaults, if any, in the Premises. 28. HOLDOVER. In the event Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the expiration of this Lease with the consent of Landlord and without the execution of a new lease, it shall be deemed to be occupying said premises as a tenant from month-to-month, subject to all of the conditions, provisions and obligations of this Lease insofar as the same are applicable to a month-to-month tenancy until the termination of such tenancy and the Base Rent shall be at 150% of the latest Base Rent applicable under this Lease. 29. TRANSFER BY LANDLORD. In the event of a sale or conveyance by Landlord of the Building to a party that assumes in writing Landlords obligations under the Lease, the same shall operate to release Landlord from any future liability upon any of the covenants or conditions herein contained, and in such event Tenant agrees to look solely to the successor in interest of Landlord in and to this Lease. This Lease shall not be affected by any such sale or conveyance, and Tenant agrees to attorn to the purchaser or grantee, which shall be obligated on this Lease only so long as it is the owner of Landlords interest in and to this Lease. 30. SUBORDINATION. Subject to and only upon execution by Tenant and the relevant lienholder of a subordination, nondisturbance and attornment agreement in form and content reasonably acceptable to Tenant and such lienholder, this Lease is and shall be subject and subordinate at all times to all ground or underlying leases which now exist or may hereafter be executed affecting the Building and to the lien of any mortgages now or hereafter placed on or against the Building, or on or against Landlords interest or estate therein, and including all extensions, renewals, amendments and supplements to any such lease or mortgage. Tenant covenants and agrees to execute and deliver to Landlord, within ten (10) days after request therefor from Landlord, such further instruments evidencing such subordination of this Lease to any ground or underlying leases and to the lien of any such mortgages as may be required by Landlord provided that any lessor under any such ground or underlying lease or the holder of any mortgage has agreed not to terminate or disturb Tenants right to use and occupy the Premises pursuant to the terms of this Lease so long as Tenant is not in default hereunder beyond any applicable notice and cure period. Failure of Tenant to execute and deliver such instrument within such ten (10) day period shall constitute a breach of this Lease.

MODIFICATIONS. Tenant agrees to execute any modification of this Lease which may be required by a lender as a condition to making a first mortgage loan on the Project; provided that no such modification shall alter the rent or term provided herein, or materially reduce the economic value hereof to Tenant, or materially affect Tenants business operations in the Premises, or increase Tenants financial obligations under this Lease.

It is intended that any such statement may be relied upon by any person proposing to acquire Landlords interest in this Lease or any prospective mortgagee of, or assignee of any mortgage upon, such interest. 33.

Tenant confirms that Landlord has made no representations or promises with respect to the Premises or the making or entry into of this Lease except as are expressly set forth herein, and agrees that no claim or liability shall be asserted by Tenant against Landlord for, and Landlord shall not be liable by reason of, breach of any representations or promises not expressly stated in this Lease.

ADDENDA. The provisions, if any, included at the end of this Lease, and any riders and exhibits appended to this Lease, are hereby made a part of this Lease as though set forth in full herein. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord is required to collect employment data from Tenants and shall cause Tenant to provide employment information in Exhibit F as of the Commencement Date and upon request by Landlord thereafter. Tenant further agrees to complete the forms in Exhibits G & H and/or supply other reasonably available employment data from time to time as requested by Landlord. Tenant agrees to complete such forms and provide such information in a timely manner upon request. 42. OPTION TO EXPAND. Provided that Tenant is not then in default beyond any applicable cure period under Section 24, Tenant shall have the right to expand the Premises by up to 7,853 square feet on the first floor, 103 E Badger Road (the First Floor Expansion Space), at the same terms and conditions under this Lease (except for Base Rent as provided below) commencing any time after 12/31/2013 with one hundred eighty (180) day prior notice. If Tenant exercises its right to expand (gives notice) within the first eighteen (18) months of the Lease Term, Landlord shall provide a tenant improvement allowance of twenty-four and 77/100 dollars ($24.77) per square foot for the upfit of the First Floor Expansion Space and any additional upfit will be at Tenants expense. Base Rent for the First Floor Expansion Space shall be equal to $7.65 per rentable square foot escalated at two percent (2%) per annum with the escalation being calculated from the original Commencement Date of the Lease. Tenants option to expand into the First Floor Expansion Space is subject to Landlords right to terminate as outlined in the existing Tenants current lease (AquaMost, Inc.) (the AquaMost Lease), which reads as follows: Landlord reserves the right, provided the effective date of such termination is not before December 31, 2013, to relocate Tenant to substitute premises of comparable size within the Project Landlord shall provide Tenant with written notice by either: 1) 180 day notice, in which case Landlord will pay Tenants out of pocket costs incurred with moving its furniture and equipment, or 2) 120 day notice, in which case Landlord will pay Tenant $25,000 in addition to moving expenses described above (such additional fee shall not be paid if Landlord provides replacement property on terms acceptable to Tenant). If Landlord does not offer a suitable substitute location or if Tenant does not agree on the substitute location within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlords notice, this Lease shall terminate at the end of either the one hundred eighty (180) or one hundred twenty (120) day period following Landlords notice. Should Tenant elect to expand into the First Floor Expansion Space and Landlord is obligated under the AquaMost Lease to pay the $25,000 and/or moving expense, Exact Sciences (Tenant) shall pay the actual, reasonable out of pocket expense to relocate AquaMost, Inc. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant recognizes Landlords desire to accommodate its other tenants in the building to the extent possible. To that end, Tenant agrees to work in good faith with Landlord to minimize negative impacts to such other 17 tenants as a result of exercising its expansion rights. This may include, to the extent practical, Tenant first exercising expansion rights in other areas of the building such as vacant space or the second floor space now occupied by Alexander Co. Further, Tenant agrees in good faith to provide notice whether formal or informal as early as possible giving Landlord as much time as possible to accommodate its other tenants. In addition, provided that Landlord has not leased (subject to Tenants right of first refusal) the space to a 3rd party other than the Alexander Company, Tenant shall have the right to expand into 5,810 square feet (145 E Badger Road, Suite 200) on the second floor (the Second Floor Expansion Space) as is by giving written notice to Landlord within the first eighteen (18) months of the Lease. Base rent for the Second Floor Expansion Space shall be $13 / rsf NNN escalated at two percent (2%) per annum with the escalation being calculated from the original Commencement Date of the Lease. Landlord shall provide new paint and carpet as part of this expansion into the Second Floor Expansion Space. Tenant shall provide a one hundred twenty (120) day prior notice prior to the effective date of such expansion into the Second Floor Expansion Space. If Tenant expands into either the First Floor Expansion Space or the Second Floor Expansion Space, Tenant shall extend the term of this Lease for a period of five (5) years from the effective date of the expansion, and such extension shall not be deemed an exercise of the Extension Option by Tenant. In addition, Tenant shall have the right to expand into 3,189 square feet, if such room is not included in such square footage total, (145 E Badger Road, Suite 102) on the first floor (the Suite 102 Expansion Space) by giving written notice to Landlord within the first twelve (12) months of the Lease. Base rent for the Suite 102 Expansion Space shall be $13 / rsf NNN escalated at two percent (2%) per annum with the escalation being calculated from the original Commencement Date of the Lease.", "document_id": "a3HA2M9pF0nnxsQHv1Tr9fjiV6w4-lease_591.plain", "chunk_id": "a3HA2M9pF0nnxsQHv1Tr9fjiV6w4-lease_591.plain_12", "heading": null}

Tenant shall provide sixty (60) days prior notice of its desire to expand into the Suite 102 Expansion Space to allow Landlord to prepare such space for delivery to Tenant and such space shall be added to the Premises no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after such notice. Tenants expansion into the Suite 102 Expansion Space shall be subject to Landlords ability to terminate the lease of any existing tenant in such space or relocate such tenant which Landlord shall use all reasonable efforts to do if Tenant exercises its right to expand into the Suite 102 Expansion Space. Further, Tenant shall have the right to expand into the existing campus common conference room on the first floor of the building (the Conference Room) by giving written notice to Landlord within the first twelve (12) months of the Lease.

If Tenant expands into the Suite 102 Expansion Space or the Conference Room, Tenant shall not be required to extend the term of this Lease unless expressly required to do so under the terms of the other expansion options described in this Section. 43. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. Provided that Tenant is not then in default beyond any applicable cure period under Section 24, Tenant will also have an ongoing Right of First Refusal on all remaining space within the Building (the ROFR). If, during the term of the ROFR, Landlord receives a bona fide offer or letter of intent to lease any space within the Building (the Additional Space)(the Offer), and Landlord desires to accept the Offer, then Landlord shall deliver to Tenant written notice of Landlords intention to accept the Offer (the Notice), together with a copy of the Offer certified by Landlord to be a true and complete copy (such copy may have the identity of the offeror or omitted). Tenant shall then have ten (10) 18 days, beginning with the date of delivery of the Notice, in which to notify Landlord in writing of Tenants election to amend this Lease to incorporate the Additional Space into this Lease on terms identical to those set forth in the Offer. If Tenant exercises the ROFR by written notice given to Landlord within such ten (10)-day period, then Landlord and Tenant shall enter into an amendment to this Lease to incorporate into his Lease the Additional Space in accordance with the provisions of said Offer. If, within ten (10) days of delivery by Landlord to Tenant of the Notice, Tenant has failed to exercise the ROFR pursuant to the terms of this Section, then the ROFR shall be null, void and of no further force and effect whatsoever as it applies to the Additional Space, provided that Landlord and the tenant that submitted the Offer enter into a binding lease in accordance with the Offer terms within 120 days after the date of the Notice.

In no event shall Tenants Proportionate Share of C.A.M. be increased in any Lease Year (as hereinafter defined) more than five percent (5%) over Tenants Proportionate Share of C.A.M. during the immediately preceding Lease Year.

The Fixed Minimum Rent payable hereunder includes Tenants Proportionate Share of all real estate taxes or assessments, both general and special (collectively, Taxes), levied upon the Property during the calendar year 2005 (Base Year). In the event that the amount of Taxes payable during the term of this Lease exceed the amount of Taxes payable during the Base Year, then in such event Tenant shall pay to Landlord in equal monthly installments, in advance with payments of fixed minimum rent, an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the estimated amount of Tenants Proportionate Share of Taxes. Within thirty (30) days 3 after the actual amount of Tenants Proportionate Share of Taxes has been determined by Landlord, based on the actual Taxes, Landlord shall notify Tenant and Tenant shall pay to Landlord or Landlord shall credit to Tenants account for future payments of Taxes, as the case may be, the difference between the estimated amount of Tenants Proportionate Share of Taxes theretofore paid to Landlord for such year and the actual amount of Tenants Proportionate Share of Taxes for such year. In addition to Tenants Proportionate Share of Taxes, Tenant shall also reimburse Landlord, immediately upon demand, for the full amount of any increases in Taxes resulting from alterations or improvements to the Premises made by or for the benefit of Tenant.

The amount payable by Tenant pursuant to this Section 2.4 for the year in which this Lease commences or terminates shall be prorated based on the ratio of that portion of the term of this Lease to the applicable tax year. If the amount of Taxes payable by Landlord with respect to Landlords Property for the Base Year includes any special assessments (in any case, Assessment) that expire at any time during the term of this Lease, then, at such time as the applicable portion of the Assessment is paid in full, the amount of Taxes for the Base Year shall be recalculated to exclude the amount of the applicable portion of the Assessment that was paid in full. Commencing as of the year of such recalculation of Taxes for the Base Year and continuing for each and every year or fraction thereof during the term of this Lease following the new calculation, or until such time as Taxes for the Base Year are again recalculated, Tenant shall pay to Landlord Tenants Proportionate Share of any increase in Taxes based upon the adjusted Base Year amount. For purposes of this Section 2.4 and Sections 2.2 and 2.5 of this Lease, Tenants Proportionate Share means the percentage determined by dividing the number of square feet of floor area in the Premises by the total square feet of net leasable floor area from time to time contained in the buildings on Landlords Property. As of the date hereof, Tenants Proportionate Share 12.5%.

Within thirty (30) days after the actual amount of Tenants Proportionate Share of Landlords Insurance has been determined by Landlord, based on the actual cost and expense of Landlords Insurance, Landlord shall so notify Tenant and Tenant shall pay to Landlord or Landlord shall credit to Tenants account for future payments of Landlords Insurance, as the case may be, the difference between the estimated amount of Tenants Proportionate Share of Landlords Insurance theretofore paid to Landlord for such year and the actual amount of Tenants Proportionate Share of Landlords Insurance for such year. The amount payable by Tenant pursuant to this Section 2.5 for the year in which this Lease commences or terminates shall be prorated based on the number of days in such partial year. 2.6 Late Charge and Default Interest.

{"text": "Exhibit 10.4 WIDMER BROTHERS BREWING COMPANY RESTATED LEASE Smithson & McKay Limited Liability Company, Lessor and Widmer Brothers Brewing Company, Lessee Dated As Of January 1, 1994 RESTATED LEASE This Restated Lease, dated as of January 1, 1994, is made between Smithson & McKay Limited Liability Company, an Oregon limited liability company (Lessor), and Widmer Brothers Brewing Company, an Oregon Corporation (Lessee). P R E M I S E S A. Lessor is the owner of the real property described as 929 N. Russell, City of Portland, County of Multnomah, State of Oregon (Premises), as more fully described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein; and B. Lessor wishes to continue to lease to Lessee and Lessee wishes to continue to lease from Lessor said real property (Premises): C. This Lease restates and supersedes all lease documents for the Premises executed prior to the date of this document. Where there is a conflict between this Restated Lease and any predecessor documents, this document shall prevail. In consideration of the premises and the covenants expressed herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows: 1. Lease of Premises. Lessor hereby leases and demises to Lessee, and Lessee hereby leases and takes from Lessor, the Premises for the term and upon the agreements, covenants and conditions set forth herein. The Premises consist of the underlying real estate and shell condition upon which Lessees offices, restaurant, and part of its brewery are located. Lessee has made substantial improvements to the shell condition of the Premises. 2. Term. 2.1 The term of this Lease commenced on May 1, 1989 (Commencement Date) and terminates on December 31, 2034, unless sooner terminated pursuant to any provisions hereof. 2.2 Option to Extend. Lessee may extend the term until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the expiration date by written notice of its election to do so given to Lessor at least one (1) year prior to the December 31, 2034 expiration date. Lessee may extend for a second term of ten (10) years by giving written notice to Lessor at least one (1) year prior to the expiration of the first extended term. The terms and conditions of the Lease applicable at the expiration date will govern the extended term; however, the monthly rent will be the fair market rent for the Premises on the expiration date. If Lessor and Lessee are unable to agree upon the fair market rent prior to the expiration date, the question will be submitted to arbitration according to Paragraph 30. In that event, Lessee will continue to pay rent according to the Lease until the arbitration decision is rendered. At that time, Lessor and Lessee will make appropriate adjustments as of the expiration date. Lessee will not have any rights under this Paragraph if: (a) an event of default - 1 - exists on the expiration date or on the date on which Lessee gives its notice; or (b) Lessee exercises its rights less than one (1) year before the expiration date. 3. Rent. 3.1 Lessee will pay Lessor the monthly rent in equal consecutive monthly installments on or before the first day of each month during the term of this Lease. The monthly rent will be paid in advance at the address specified for Lessor in the basic lease information or such other place as Lessor designates, without prior demand and without any abatement, deduction or setoff. If the commencement date occurs on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, or if the expiration date occurs on a day other than the last day of the calendar month, then the monthly rent for each fractional month will be prorated on a daily basis. This is a triple net lease with all expenses, maintenance, renovation, and replacement assumed by Lessee. 3.2 Monthly rent is as follows: Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) per month subject to a yearly consumer price index adjustment as described below. CPI Adjustments: The Basic Annual Rent shall be subject to upward adjustments, based on the Consumer Price Index, one year after the Commencement Date of this Lease and at the end of each subsequent year, during the Lease Term in accordance with the following procedure: (A) The index to be used for this adjustment shall be the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), All Items, U.S. City Average (1982-1984 equals 100), published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. (B) The Base Period Consumer Price index shall be subtracted from the Adjustment Period Consumer Price Index; the difference shall be divided by the Base Period Consumer Price Index. This quotient shall then be multiplied by $3,000.00. The result shall be added to the monthly rent of $3,000.00. This arithmetical sum shall then be the Adjusted Monthly Rent for such immediately succeeding leasehold year which shall be paid monthly. (C) If the Consumer Price Index is, at any time during the term of this Lease, discontinued or no longer published, then the most nearly comparable published measure of inflation, as determined by Lessor in its sole discretion, shall be substituted for the purpose of this calculation. 4. Taxes and Other Charges. 4.1 Lessee agrees to pay and discharge, as additional rent for the Premises during the entire term of this Lease, before delinquency, all taxes, assessments, water rents, sewer rentals, utility rates and fees, levies or other charges of any kind which are or may during the term of this Lease be levied, charged, assessed or imposed upon - 2 - or against the Premises or any buildings or improvements which are hereafter located thereon, or against any legal or equitable interest of Lessor in the Premises, or against any of Lessees personal property now or hereafter located thereon, or which may be levied, charged, assessed or imposed upon or against the leasehold estate created hereby.

In the event that Lessee fails to notify Lessor within said thirty (30) day period of Lessees election to exercise its right of first refusal, or in the event Lessee notifies Lessor within said period that Lessee will not exercise its right of first refusal, Lessor may proceed to sell, transfer or assign its fee title or part thereof or interest therein to the third party within ninety (90) days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, but only on the same terms and conditions as were offered to Lessee, and any change in such terms and conditions shall be deemed to be a new offer and Lessee shall in such event not consummate any sale, assignment or other transfer to any third party but shall first submit the changed terms and conditions to Lessee for determination by Lessee in the manner provided above as to whether it will elect to exercise its right of first refusal on the changed terms and conditions. In the event that Lessee has elected not to exercise its right of first refusal and the sale or transfer of the Lessors interest in the Premises as described in the offer is not completed for any reason within the aforesaid ninety (90) day period, the Lessee shall have, upon the same conditions and notice, the continuing right of first refusal to purchase Lessors interest in the Premises upon the terms of any subsequent", "document_id": "a7rmOv9KIRi17lhunO74q9TDcEwa-lease_792.plain", "chunk_id": "a7rmOv9KIRi17lhunO74q9TDcEwa-lease_792.plain_11", "heading": null}
